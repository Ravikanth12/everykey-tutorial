# Installing the Anykey Toolchain on Windows.

## Install cygwin ...

You'll need to download cygwin tools in order to have a working copy of
`git`. `make` and a C-compiler that you need to compile a tool to update
the checksum in the generated firmware (don't worry if you don't know
what this means.. :)

Go to [http://cygwin.com/intall.html] and download the `setup.exe`
